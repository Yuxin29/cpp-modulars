Type                            Recommended Style	Example                 Explanation
Member variables (non-static)	camelCase with _	_fixedPointValue	    Makes it clear that itâ€™s a class member variable
Static variables (non-constant)	camelCase/prefix    s_	s_instanceCount	    Optional, often used to differentiate static members
Static / global constants	    (MACRO style)	    FRACTIONAL_BITS_NUMBER	Easy to identify as a constant at a glance
Functions / methods	            camelCase	        getRawBits()	        Common function naming convention
Class / struct names	        PascalCase	        Fixed	                Standard naming for C++ classes
