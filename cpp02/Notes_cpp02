--> Orthodox Canonical Form
Default constructor		    create and initiate
Copy constructor		    initiate this obj using another obj
Copy assignment operator	asign an obj to another exiting obj --->>check this != &other to avoid "self-asigning", return a *this to support assining chain
Destructor		            realise memory

--> Conventional naming habit in cpp
Type                            Recommended Style	Example                 Explanation
Member variables (non-static)	camelCase with _	_fixedPointValue	    Makes it clear that it’s a class member variable
Static variables (non-constant)	camelCase/prefix    s_	s_instanceCount	    Optional, often used to differentiate static members
Static / global constants	    (MACRO style)	    FRACTIONAL_BITS_NUMBER	Easy to identify as a constant at a glance
Functions / methods	            camelCase	        getRawBits()	        Common function naming convention
Class / struct names	        PascalCase	        Fixed	                Standard naming for C++ classes

Static const int _fractionalBitsNumber = 8;
---> we represent fractors with 8 bit binary nbr
---> example
42.42 * 2^8 = 42.42 * 256 ≈ 10859
reverse-> 10859 / 2^8 = 10859 / 256 ≈ 42.4219
