the aim of ex00: capitalize and print out a string.

------main in cpp--------
main in cpp is basicly the same as c
int main(int ac, char **av)

------print in cpp--------
headers: 
<iostream>       std::cout   std::cin    std::cerr   std::clog   std::endl
<string>        std::string     s+=...

std::cout << ... << std:: endl
cout        stdout
<<          insertation operator
std:: endl  end of the line and flush the stdout 

------print in c++98 and after c++98--------
std::cout << std::format("Hello {}, number = {}\n", name, number);

------toupper in cpp--------
headers: 
<cctype>      std::toupper


------styels in c and c++------
c       av[i][j]     char level toupper, rely on sting end is nulll
c++     av[i]           std:string  a package 

features of Object Oriented Programing
- Encapsulation: put data, attributes and funcitons within one class, and hive the implementations details internally
- Abstraction:  show the result but not the process 
- Inheritance:  new class can be based on extension class, to reuse exiting code and build hiertachy of classes
- Polymorphism: different classes can be called with same way, so it is flexible


--> some practice with VAR types
int main()
{
    std::string name = "Summer";
    int number = 5;
    std::cout << "hello " << name << ", you are " << number << " years old." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

On program start-up, the phonebook is empty and the user is prompted to enter one
of three commands. The program only accepts ADD, SEARCH and EXIT.
Any other input is discarded.
Once a command has been correctly executed, the program waits for another one. It
stops when the user inputs EXIT.

------cpp and hpp--------
in c++, normally one .cpp and one .hpp

------PhoneBook---------
there is not ac or av, 
in ./PhoneBook, it just enters the program

------get line---------
<string>
